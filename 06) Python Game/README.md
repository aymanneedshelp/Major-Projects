## I'm Bored
For our Term 1 - Computational Thinking and Design (CTD) project, we were asked to create a game using only inbuilt python functions. Our game was
themed around random internet facts and required the player to guess whether what was displayed was indeed true or not.

It uses simple tkinter shapes to build a retro style user interface and a csv file to store and read the facts from, so that new ones can be
added on without changing the code. We did our best to use this project to show our knowledege in python and thus even used classes when designing it.
